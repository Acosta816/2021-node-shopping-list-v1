/* 
In this server.js module we actually don't care if the runServer is asynchronous because we are going to open the server to normal use and keep it open so this module can run in order from top to bottom (synchronously).
In testing however, we are constantly opening and closing the server to clear out the junk from each unit test so each unit test is run fairly with clean data.
So we need a way of making the tests run ONLY after the server is open.

//require.main is assigned to a module when that module is run directly from Node like when the npm start script auto-runs "node server.js".
//This is opposed to it being run from the testing module. We donâ€™t want this to auto run when we import it/ require it in the shopping-list.TEST.js file which is what happens.

//So it's possible to determine if a file is run directly from node by testing if require.main === module      (module refers to the current module, this module)
